## Talks I have given
### [Creating Emotionally Relevant Experiences with Fluent Design](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/T6092-R1)  
[Claudio Guglieri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudioguglieri/), [Mike Harnisch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-harnisch-08aba01/) & I talk about how we brought the fluent design language into various in-box windows apps (Groove, Movies & TV)

### [LaunchDarkly: Custom Attributes for Fun & Scale](https://launchdarkly.com/galaxy/custom-attributes-for-fun-and-scale/)  
Feature flagging goes deeper than an on-off toggle. Sometimes you need to think differently about what a user really use. Listen to myself and [Matthieu Labbé](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieulabbe/) talk about it for 15 minutes.

## Websites That I like
[Pointer.Dev](http://www.pointer.io)  
This is a good aggregator, and helps me discover new people. Defo. recommended.

[Pragmatic Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com)  
Really great general blog about engineering, with a tilt towards management

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)  
I know, I know. I visit when I’m bored, *OK?*

[Raph Leviens Blog](https://raphlinus.github.io/)  
Super nerdy, super technical, but makes me think deeper about some things

[Tanya Reilly](https://noidea.dog/blog)  
I love this blog because it just speaks to me about the reality of being a senior+ IC

[InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com)  
While mostly service focused, they post many talks that plant some interesting seeds in my brain. I’ve waned on it recently ‘cause I was like a kid in a candy store wanting to watch all the videos.

[I.M. Wrights “Hard Code”](https://imwrightshardcode.com)  
Used to have a good take on tech ‘management’. Management awareness and the realties of it are key to being that Senior+ engineer

[Dan Abramov’s blog](https://khairold.com)  
Mr React; great writing, if long. Not just about react, if you think more deeply about what he says

[Graham Lee](https://www.sicpers.info)  
Pithy, Short, technical in nature, but not *technical-technical*.

[Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com)  
While the author doesn’t blog much any more, their older stuff is good. Co founder of Stack Overflow

[Rands In Repose](https://randsinrepose.com)  
How To manage Geeks / Being Geek author. Not as deep as he used to be, still worth a subscribe. The older stuff – and their books – have been *amazingly* formative for me and my thinking about managing myself

[The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org)  
This person takes research papers, and makes them readable by normal people like me. They’re always interesting, and always make you think a lot more critically about technical things.

[The Old New Thing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/)  
This might be controversial since it’s very Windows-Platform/C++ focused, but Raymond has a great style of explaining super complex topics in a layered fashion. It’s just great reading that encourages you to think about how you solve problems from ‘ok’ / ‘good enough’ / ‘great’ / ‘awesome’

[Uber Engineering](https://eng.uber.com)  
Uber may not be the nest company culturally, but they do some /great/ tech. Their blog posts are lovely and informative.
