title: Toots I wasn’t going to post (but now will)

I’ve been writing down random thoughts for a while now — just a little way to
get the mental bug out of my head and think about something else for a while.
They’re almost entirely tech related. I kept them in an doc titled “Toots I’ll
never post” — it was previously called “Tweets I’ll never post”, but well
_gestures_. So now they’re toots ‘cause fml “posts I’ll never posts” is a
terrible title, and… I’m not ready to call them Skeets either.

My plan is to post them here posterity purposes. But I’ll also be posting social
media (e.g., Bluesky and Mastodon) in a threaded format, and link back to the
associated blog post.
