# Software Engineering
- Software needs to evolve. You can‚Äôt just evolve it in specific, dedicated rewrites or ‚Äòfoundation‚Äô milestones. You should leverage feature work to *evolve* your foundations & infrastructure. [The Mechanics of Software Evolution](https://kislayverma.com/software-architecture/the-mechanics-of-software-evolution/)
- ‚ÄùNo Bugs‚Äù is a quality approach that comes up in cycles. I‚Äôve seen it at the industry level, and on specific teams. Similar trope, repeated on a cycle. While not the first, I thought this memo from Microsoft in **1989** titled ‚ÄúZero Defects‚Äù was surprisingly pragmatic (albeit with a bit of brogrammer in there). [Zero Defects](https://sriramk.com/memos/zerodef.pdf)
- Developer productivity is [near](https://www.codevoid.net/ruminations/2022/04/05/file-new-project-innerloop.html) and [dear](https://www.codevoid.net/ruminations/2022/04/12/demoralized-by-complexity.html) to my heart. It gets talked about, but sometimes you need to take a step back from the measurable ‚Äòbetter compile times‚Äô. This article is a nice revisit as to why it‚Äôs more important than ‚Äòjust work quicker‚Äô. [A dev‚Äôs thoughts on developer productivity](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/developer-productivity-thoughts)
- C++ is powerful. It‚Äôs also an ecosystem inhabited by pedants, in-groups, and complexity junkies. I thought this was a nice reflection on the dumbassery that often appears in those group (and I say this as someone who really quite likes C++ when used sensibly). [Scholars of Trivia](https://blog.royalsloth.eu/posts/scholars-of-trivia/)
- In every UI platform I‚Äôve worked in, I feel I‚Äôve easily grasped the different layout options, and how to ~~ab~~use them for good. For some reason I‚Äôve never *quite* had the same intuition for the web. This article really helped let me revisit that. [Understanding Layout Algorithms](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/)
- RFC/Spec/Guidance/Something for ‚ÄòVirtual Threads‚Äô in the JVM. Pretty baller! Reminds me a lot of [fibers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/using-fibers) in Windows. [JEP 425: Virtual Threads \(Preview\)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/425)
- Rust seems fancy, but suffers from the reality that no-one has made a UI stack in it that feels viable, or modern, or not some *abstraction* over all other platforms. While the architecture detailed in this article doesn‚Äôt *solve* that, it does feel like an attempt to bring something concrete in that space.

# Leadership / Management / Career
* Getting organisations to invest in ‚Äòplatform‚Äô or ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô teams is difficult. It‚Äôs even more difficult in situations where it doesn‚Äôt *appear* there is shared infra ‚Äî aka just a mobile or desktop app. I spent six years running a team that built shared **app** infrastructure ‚Äî before that I spent four years being the person building it. [Trunk and Branches Model for Scaling Infrastructure Organisations](https://lethain.com/trunk-and-branches/) hit a sweet spot covering this topic. I *especially* appreciated the discussion on lending members out to help teams bootstrap.
* Talk to your peer teams. We‚Äôre all going to the same place. Don‚Äôt keep ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù. [Effective Teams Don‚Äôt Keep Secrets](https://www.theadamthomas.com/effective-teams-dont-keep-secrets/)
* Throughout my career I‚Äôve seen many reach what I sometimes call a ‚Äòlocal maxima‚Äô. They‚Äôre *brilliant* at what they do, and can‚Äôt move past that to unlock *more*. Sure, sometimes it‚Äôs because they at a global maxima. But often I see them get surpassed by their peers. Often there is a strong whiff of arrogance. This pair of articles tell a better story than I can, and provide a great framework to more concrete aspects of what this really means. (ngl, I fear I‚Äôm stuck at a local maxima).

# Technology
* Looks like Apple did a bang up job on Apple Silicon: [Introduction to Apple Silicon](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Introduction-to-Apple-Silicon)
* Really interesting research / paper talking about using drug discovery ML to develop *adversarial* drugs. Aka bloody terrifying. [Dual use of artificial-intelligence-powered drug discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9)
* Online communities have a significant amount of context ‚Äî ok, so do real-world communities ‚Äî and when you [cross the streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wrEEd1ajz4), it all goes a bit [Pete Tong](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/23/arts/its-all-gone-pete-tong.html). [What‚Äôs ‚ÄòContext Collapse‚Äô? Understanding it Can Mean a More Fulfilling Online Life](https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/)
* Related to context collapse is more *private* walled gardens. People are migrating some of their online conversations behind privacy screens. [The continuing rise of virtual private neighbourhoods](https://interconnected.org/home/2021/01/07/dunbar_spaces)

# Random
* What does long term really mean? This article really makes you feel small and insignificant. [The Future Will Have To Wait](https://longnow.org/essays/omega-glory/)
* Part of me is deeply terrified of being old, for many reasons. This article really struck me deep. [On Aging Alone](https://thewalrus.ca/on-aging-alone/)
