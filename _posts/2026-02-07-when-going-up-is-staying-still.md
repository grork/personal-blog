It’s often assumed that in the world of people managers people move *up* the org
chart. It feels _implicit_. You become a manager of other managers, you’re going
“up”! But often what actually happens is you’re staying still organisationally.
You’re growing people below you — your teams become more specialised, often
narrower. People who _had_ been the rock-star ICs, expand to have a whole team
to do the same work they _used_ to do.
