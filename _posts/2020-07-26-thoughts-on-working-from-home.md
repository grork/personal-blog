description: A little waffle on working from home during the pandemic
---
I‚Äôve never enjoyed working from home. I‚Äôve always found it _more_ intense, more
_stressful_, and just, well, generally _more_. Sure, I‚Äôd work from home if I had
to (snow storms etc), but in the 16 years I‚Äôve been employed I‚Äôd always favour
being **at** work when real work was needed ‚Äî even when it was on a weekend for
just a few hours.

Working from home forced an increased intensity of work: Respond Faster to
questions (always at my desk!), actively participate in more conversations,
working longer because *of course* I could use my recovered commute time ‚Äî
otherwise I look like I‚Äôm slacking, _right_? These were self-imposed
expectations ‚Äî I‚Äôm not sure any of my employers **actually** expected that
(certainly not my current one) but it was there, unspoken whispers.

Then the pandemic happened.

Working from home is one of the most visible changes of The Distancing. With
no-way to safely gather in a physical space to _stop, drop, and collaborate_,
those with the privilege of being able to work from home **have** to. It‚Äôs
unclear if this shift is going to be forever (at least for some job types), or
just for the next half-decade. But living every day under the cloud of
expectations of increased productivity and constant availability is
unsustainable.

After two weeks of the lockdown, I was starting to feel burnt out. Those high
(mostly self-imposed) expectations, increased intensity, and running at ones
mental redline had started to take their toll. I wrote down some observations
after those two weeks to try and get a little perspective as to some day-today
causes:
- **No breaks between meetings** When you‚Äôre in the office, there's an implicit
  break between meetings as you physically move to another room. Now, you‚Äôre
  finishing **on the dot**, and immediately you are into another meeting ‚Äî it‚Äôs
  just a click away. It‚Äôs been eye-opening to realize how much I used the time
  moving between meetings to mentally reset.
- **Meetings over run, and no-one stops** Meetings no longer get kicked out of a
  conference room, which means people can talk forever, unless all participants
  have to go somewhere else. FOMO encourages this (I heavily afflicted by FOMO),
  as well as the reality that those hallways conversations that happened as you
  walked to another meeting were where so much work actually happened.
- **Multiple, concurrent realtime group conversations** In the office, you have
  *one* conversation at a time, with those physically around you. Now you end up
  in 2+ conversations as there is no signal or cue for others that you‚Äôre
  **already** dedicating 90% of your brain to a conversation, so you end up
  being drawn into those additional, concurrent, conversations.
- **Everyone can join** Group conversations that in-person resulted in a
  decision that was sometimes circulated, are now open in the public, and often
  (unintentionally) pull in more people to participate (see previous point).
  Everyone can be present, even if they weren‚Äôt before. More people, more
  conversation, more noise, less signal.
- **Lunch is no longer a break (even when you take a break)** Because of the
  continuous intensity, lunch becomes a release valve ‚Äî but in many cases, not
  in a take-a-break way. Previously, people left the workspace and socialized.
  Now it‚Äôs the time to send Slack messages & e-mail to follow up from all those
  no-moment-to-breath back-to-back meetings. Upon your return from a
  lunch-break, your inbox & instant messages are on üî•
- **There's no end to the day** Our home lives have been turned upside down,
  many of us spending much of the working day taking care of family. But the
  *implicit* assumption is that of course you‚Äôre still going to put a full eight
  hours in. So, you work later after hours, to make up the difference. (See the
  [Microsoft Office teams pull request completion
  time](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/20/helping-developers-stay-productive-working-remote))
- **Workaholism** All things being equal, I‚Äôd work all the time. Part of my
  management technique has been ‚ÄòI‚Äôm at home. Not work‚Äô, and avoiding working
  from home. Now work is just sitting there in my home office saying ‚ÄòCome on.
  Do some more work‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll be able to get ahead‚Äô. I won‚Äôt, and I shouldn‚Äôt, but
  merely resisting that takes energy ‚Äî even when you succeed, the energy used to
  resist this is significant.

That's before you acknowledge that the outside world, is changing hour by hour,
in a way that _does_ impact your life, requiring immediate re-planning &
assessment.

We‚Äôre well into what is clearly going to be at least a 24-month work from home
situation. I‚Äôve found some techniques that have tempered ‚Äî but not eliminated ‚Äî
my stress, anxiety, and burn out:
1. **Blocked out specific parts of my calendar** to create some space breathable
   space. If you use Office 365, I highly recommend turning on ‚Äú[Focus
   Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/focus-plan)‚Äù
   to automatically ensure you don‚Äôt get overbooked.
2. **Disabled Slack & e-mail notifications on my phone** ‚Äî even during the workday.
   I‚Äôve also disabled red-dot on Slack for work email, except for DMs &
   mentions. Don‚Äôt tempt my lizard-fomo brain!
3. **Asked people to schedule meetings 5 min delayed start or early end**. Shortly
   after I started doing this informally, my employer made it a formal policy.
   Reality is that it only happens about 25% of the time (and people still blow
   past the end of a meeting)
4. **Started my workday a little later, and finishing a little earlier** (8:30
   start, 17:00-17:30 stop). Initially, I‚Äôd fallen into ‚Äòstart when I‚Äôd have
   left for work, stop when I‚Äôd have left for home‚Äô, which was really 7:30-6:15,
   and it wasn‚Äôt working. Upside, I was no longer eating my breakfast at my desk
   reviewing e-mails!
5. **Made heavy use of ‚Äòremind me‚Äô in slack** to follow up on conversations rather
   than participating actively. Remind me, and get back to it end of the
   day/next day.
6. **Consciously & intentionally using Slack status messages** to convey when I‚Äôm
   not at my desk (and why) for more than a potty break.

There is no simple solution, nor is there one-size fits all. We all have unique
situations that put different pressure on how we plan our day. We are also all
individuals who have different preferences & desires. Hopefully, my rumination
and unsolicited pontification at least sparks a thought for ways to mange your
workday.
   
_Prepublication addendum_: Via my boss at work, I came across a Harvard Business
Review article ‚Äú[Microsoft Analysed Data on Its Newly Remote
Workforce](https://hbr.org/2020/07/microsoft-analyzed-data-on-its-newly-remote-workforce)‚Äù.
To my surprised it meshed really well with what I wrote above. If you would
like a more data-driven, less opinion-based version, I would recommend taking a
quick read!
