There is a vision of the future of computer interaction. It varies by organisation.
Apple showed us theirs — the Vision Pro. The rest of the world is — it seems — betting
on The Chat Box™ with a side bet on "The Web" & offloading everything to the cloud.
You see this through the development of more web experiences, and that web is the
de-facto UX stack of choice. It's a stark comparison to Vision Pro, which is not only
choosing to be on native experiences, but it also attempted to present a differentiated
vision (ha) of the future.

I continue to be a believer in “goggles” being “the future” — The Chat Box™ can’t be it.
Nor can it be screaming into the void, hoping it screams back.
