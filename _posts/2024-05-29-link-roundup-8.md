I note, for the record, once again there seem to be a large number of AI related links. I think this is a byproduct of the times we're living in that the visible 'new and interesting' (good, or bad) things in the industry are AI. I certainly make zero claims about any sensible understanding of the underlying technology that goes into making the GPUs go Brrrr. But I do find it fasinating.

# Technology
- [Your tech or my tech](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/your-tech-my-tech/): At what point, and what trade offs, do you make when you decide the thing is no longer your core competency?
- [Distracted](https://lmnt.me/blog/distracted.html): This is something I think about a lot. I have so many thoughts in my ‚Äòill thought through pontifications‚Äô pile related to this. We‚Äôve lost sight of something ‚Äî but I‚Äôm too distracted to really understand what that was.
- [The Next 40](https://furbo.org/2024/01/29/the-next-40/): The iPad and Apple Vision Pro are held back by software policy. I understand the motivation for those restrictions, but they have to relent. We have to allow a greater depth of capability in our software environment ‚Äî it‚Äôs critical to unleash a whole new era of amazing hardware in amazing places. The hardware is ready ‚Äî waiting to be unleashed.
- [Cyber-security pre-war reality check](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/): I‚Äôve had similar ‚Äî not as well articulated ‚Äî thoughts in my idle moments wondering how the giant jenga that is modern tech continues to function when we all know it‚Äôs sticks & bubble gum. At least the US, for the most part, does still have the expertise to ‚Äòrebuild‚Äô, or ‚Äòown‚Äô the infrastructure. Except where it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äî say, [repairing underwater cables](https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships), which seems to be something the US doesn‚Äôt have domiciled within its control (except maybe the military?)

# "AI" / LLMs
- [Intro to Large Language Models](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g): a great intro to the high level mechanics of how an LLM comes into existence
- [How the frontier became the slogan of uncontrolled AI](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/02/how-the-frontier-became-the-slogan-of-uncontrolled-ai.html): Brilliantly scathing piece on the hubris, and expansionism around AI. I‚Äôm not entirely sure I‚Äôm 100% aligned with it, but it‚Äôs thought provoking nonetheless.
- [The Value of LLMs](https://bsky.app/profile/martin.kleppmann.com/post/3kquvol6s5b2a): This resonates well with me. LLMs produce things that are believable, but maybe wrong. I have to do this all the time with everything in my job ‚Äî adding another layer (multiple!) of indirection & ambiguity does not make my job easier _or_ better.
- [Looking for AI use cases](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/4/19/looking-for-ai-use-cases): A great take on AI (well, chat bots / autonomous agents), and I‚Äôm in total agreement. It reminds me of the arc of Goggles. AI *is* the future, but we‚Äôre not *in* the future. Yet. (and it‚Äôs  a long way away)
- [AI isnt useless](https://www.citationneeded.news/ai-isnt-useless/): Molly white does a brilliant job of capturing how I feel about The AIs. She writes so well, and covers nuance. Love it. (I wish we could agree to call ML ML, and leave AI to the future)
- A series of papers that tell a journey for Apple, and how they think they‚Äôve found a real world use case for the LLM. Reading these makes me feel they‚Äôre really about accessibility scenarios, but maybe they‚Äôre able to get them sufficiently rich to work for the Siri case.
  - [MARRS (reference resolution)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01650v1)
  - [MM1 (combining ferret model)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611v3)
  - [ReALM (more reference resolution)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20329v1P)
  - [Ferret-UI (putting all of it together)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05719v1)
- [Among the AI doomsayers](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/18/among-the-ai-doomsayers): Maybe I‚Äôve been around too long, but this article feels like an echo of the various booms of the last 25 years ‚Äî The Internet (DotCom), ‚ÄúTechnology‚Äù (Web 2.0), and to a lesser extent Crypto. It‚Äôs quirky (to the external observer) written about _by_ an outsider seeking insight and failing to find any. But because of the quirkiness, it feels like it‚Äôs shining a light onto a unique story. But I remember this with the DotCom boom/bust, and most definitely with the nascent Web 2.0. It‚Äôs not a failure of the times, or even the article, but it‚Äôs important to remember that when we say ‚Äòhistory doesn‚Äôt repeat, but it does rhyme‚Äô, that includes the cycles.

# Software Engineering
- [Breaking down tasks](https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/11/breaking-down-tasks/): In my career, one of the pivotal learnings that let me become efficient at work was _breaking tasks down_. Before going through the ringer to learn this, I‚Äôd just split out work as a series of hand-wavy, laissez-faire buckets of work without a real plan. Would it be easier? Would it be harder? idk man, i‚Äôm just going on _vibes_. But having to break them into tasks that represented _no more than 4hrs of work_ transformed how I thought about it. The reality is: It‚Äôs not the *tasks* that matter ‚Äî it‚Äôs the process & journey that enlightens you to the real work you‚Äôve got to do
- [Laws of Software Evolution](https://two-wrongs.com/laws-of-software-evolution): This hit hard; so much we do in software is ‚Äòtear it down and start again‚Äô, and not enough ‚Äòhow can set this up to evolve‚Äô. There are so many different approaches, and people get stuck in those ways of thinking ‚Äî often with the misguided belief of ‚ÄòIf we just got it done in this one right way, it‚Äôd be solved‚Äô, and thats so rarely the case. Definitely worth the 3-5 minute read while waiting for the kettle to boil & your tea to steep.
- [Swift concurrency waits for no one](https://saagarjha.com/blog/2023/12/22/swift-concurrency-waits-for-no-one/): Lovely read on the perils of concurrency runtimes - in Swift, in this case. While I‚Äôm told this is very different to the C# async/await, it feels very similar to me - unexpected forward progress problems with thread starvation. But maybe I‚Äôm just a noob and pattern match too much

# Leadership / Management / Career
- [The Builders Guide to Better Mousetraps](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/03/04/mousetrap.html): A nice, short ‚Äì and low-preaching ‚Äì review of how you should think about tackling new problem areas. Reminded me of the phrase ‚Äúis the juice worth the squeeze‚Äù
- [Developer Productivity For Humans](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2023/01/09994260/1JgvStCbvcQ): How can we understand, measure, and improve the ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù of developers? What are the real things that we need to understand & measure to make it possible to actually improve it. This is a great multi-part (Part [2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10043615) (not interesting), [3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109339), [4](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10176199), [5](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273824), [6](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2023/06/10339107/1SwMIXXv6Y8), [7](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372494/references)) series from a team at Googles purpose was do original research into this topic.
- [Layers Of Context](https://lethain.com/layers-of-context/): Understanding _context_ is crucial. Being aware there is more than one context is crucial. Do not be blinded by your local context.
- [Multi-dimensional tradeoffs](https://lethain.com/multi-dimensional-tradeoffs/): So often we look at trade offs in this kinda single or maybe two axis choice. This way, or the other way. However, there are often more than those first-glance dimensions to them ‚Äî and people can‚Äôt see the wood for the trees. But uncovering those additional dimensions of insight can help you make it much clearer which direction you should head.

# Random
- [Money Bubble](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/02/25/Money-AI-Bubble): AI, Financing, the end of ZIRP, and the weight of the expectation of profits go up.
- [Muse Retrospective](https://adamwiggins.com/muse-retrospective/): Building it well, with love, passion and perceived problem-solving does not guarantee success. Also I feel like this *specific* is something *many* have taken a run at, and no-one has cracked it. Apple with Freeform, Miro, FigmaJam etc are not far from this particular Apple tree. Makes me wonder if it‚Äôs just not a good paradigm.
- [Coming of Age at the dawn of the social internet](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/coming-of-age-at-the-dawn-of-the-social-internet): I lament the loss of the internet ‚Äî both social- and the wider- internet ‚Äî in a way that feels very strange. This article captures a good sense of that ‚Äî although, entirely different in its detail. I wonder if my continuing distaste of ‚Äòoptimization above all‚Äô extends beyond pure commerce, to the social web? We have driven ourselves to *optimize* our social projection, to maximise some quality of it. We can‚Äôt just let it be ‚Äî we can‚Äôt even be authentic, in our authenticness.
- [Politics and the English language](https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit): George Orwell opines upon the relationship between language and politics. I think this expands to all writing - technical writing gets caught up here too. We can do better.
