Recently, I was watching a talk by [Matt Drance](https://twitter.com/drance)
from his 2015 CocoaConf talk ["What The Race Track Taught Me About Software
Development"](https://vimeo.com/131824328) _[Currently unavailable]_. I wanted
to watch it because I’ve found his tweets & writings in the past to be
interesting & thought provoking — that and I like to think I’m kinda a car guy.
Race tracks? Software development? Sure, this should be fun!

It’s message is not so much that _racing_ is the lens through which to view
everything because, _gosh_, racing is just so super fantastic. It’s the
**perspective** with which you view your work — no matter what that work is.
Looking not at just today, or tomorrow, but next week, month, year all the time.

There are so many facets. The idea that the obvious direct path might not
actually be the fastest is key— sometimes you’ve got to slow down to go faster.
The idea that to move faster, add more features, and fix more bugs, you need to
slow down a little to create a clearer path forward. This isn’t because slowing
down gives you more time to work out _what’s next_, it’s because that speed
reduction allows you to take a **more direct path** to your chosen destination.
You can take the opportunity to approach the problem a little more radically
_because_ you’re not travelling 1,000 MPH towards oblivion.

> "The thing about fundamentals, is they scale. They work at any level"

This perspective, this approach, this _skill_ is something that once understood,
and applied habitually, is able to be carried forward to larger problems. Matt
calls out that if you _understand_ the fundamental patterns, practices in a
project with 20 files, you can apply them with equal competency to a project of
2,000 files. It scales — it’s all the same _perspective_.

I was especially enamored towards the end where Mr. Drance brought in a clip
where one racer adjusts the mirror of the racer close beside them, and says:  
> "If you're not trolling, you're not friends"

The clarification and reiteration that this is clearly between people who are
friends but yet are able to **compete** and strive to excel at what they do; you
don’t start a race with no intent of _racing_, but that doesn’t have to mean
dog-eat-dog, and a culture of animosity.

The people we work with are all there to pull in the same direction — to move
things forward, to make progress with whatever endeavor is being engaged in.
Sure, there are different motivations, and different stories about why people
are there, but it’s not just the best place to start from.

It’s the only way.
